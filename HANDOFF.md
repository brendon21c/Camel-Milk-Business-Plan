# Project Handoff — Business Viability Intelligence System
**Last updated:** 2026-04-08 (Session 4)

---

## What This Project Is

An automated business viability intelligence system that answers:
> *Is a given business idea viable — and how does that picture change over time?*

Generic by design. First proposition: exporting dehydrated camel milk powder from Somalia to the US health food market. Future ideas are new rows in the `propositions` table — no new code needed.

System runs research agents → assembles PDF report → delivers by email on a client schedule or on demand.

## Infrastructure — COMPLETE

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Supabase DB (6 tables) | Done |
| `supabaseClient.js` + `db.js` | Done |
| `.env` with all API keys | Done |
| `assets/logo.png` | Done |
| Seed data (Brendon + camel milk proposition) | Done |
| `package.json` (supabase-js, dotenv) | Done |

**Supabase project:** `https://vupnhlpwfqwmrysohhrq.supabase.co`

**Seed IDs:**
- Client (Brendon McKeever): `ea134c2d-547e-4fcb-b475-65383680c8fb`
- Proposition (Camel Milk Export): `54f51272-d819-4d82-825a-15603ed48654`

## Pending DB Migrations (run before building tools)

```sql
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN status TEXT DEFAULT 'prospect';
ALTER TABLE propositions ADD COLUMN status TEXT DEFAULT 'prospect';
ALTER TABLE propositions ADD COLUMN factor_weights JSONB;
ALTER TABLE reports ADD COLUMN error_message TEXT;
```

Status values — clients: `prospect | active | inactive`
Status values — propositions: `prospect | proposal_sent | active | paused | inactive`

## All Decisions — LOCKED

| # | Decision | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Research method | Hybrid — Claude agents + Brave Search API |
| 2 | Report structure | 14 sections, brand colors, viability score |
| 3 | Report delivery | Resend email to `brennon.mckeever@gmail.com`. PDF attached. No SMS (Twilio shelved — A2P registration required, no website yet). |
| 4 | Run trigger | Per-proposition schedule in DB. On-demand: `node run.js --proposition-id <id> --force` |
| 5 | Baseline vs delta | Full fresh report every run + "What Changed" bullets from run 2 onwards. 6 months history. |
| 6 | Agent architecture | 1 Sonnet orchestrator, ~5 Haiku research sub-agents, 1 Sonnet assembler |
| 7 | Viability score | 6 factors (Market Demand, Regulatory, Competitive, Financial, Supply Chain, Risk), each 1–5, client-defined weights. 4–5 Strong / 2.5–3.9 Moderate / 1–2.4 Weak |
| 8 | Cache TTL | Per-source: market/search 24h, competitive 72h, FDA/regulatory 14 days, exchange rates 24h, Census 30 days, YouTube 72h |
| 9 | On-demand trigger | `node run.js --proposition-id <id> --force` bypasses `next_run_at` |
| 10 | Brave throttling | 500ms fixed delay between calls + exponential backoff on 429s (max 3 retries) |
| 11 | Failure alerting | Resend email to Brendon only (client not notified). Error logged to `reports.error_message`. |
| 12 | Quality check | All 9 agents complete + no null outputs + all 6 score factors populated. Hard fail on technical errors only. |
| 13 | Intake flow | Web form → Supabase (prospect) → email to Brendon → proposal PDF → `node activate.js` flips to active |
| 14 | Python env | `venv` + `requirements.txt` |

## Workflow List (11 files)

`research_market_overview.md`, `research_competitors.md`, `research_regulatory.md`, `research_production.md`, `research_packaging.md`, `research_distribution.md`, `research_marketing.md`, `research_financials.md`, `research_origin_ops.md`, `research_legal.md`, `assemble_report.md`

## What Has NOT Been Built Yet

- [ ] Run 4 pending DB migrations
- [ ] Create Supabase Storage bucket `reports` (private) — manual dashboard step
- [ ] Python `venv` + `requirements.txt`
- [ ] Directories: `workflows/`, `tools/`, `outputs/`, `.tmp/`
- [ ] `tools/search_brave.py` — core search tool with throttling
- [ ] All 11 workflow `.md` files
- [ ] All research + assembly Python tools
- [ ] `tools/intake.js`, `tools/generate_proposal.js`, `tools/activate.js`
- [ ] PDF generation + Resend email delivery
- [ ] Orchestrator (`run.js`)

---

## Build Order

1. Run 4 DB migrations
2. Create Supabase Storage bucket (manual)
3. Python venv + requirements.txt
4. Create directories
5. `tools/search_brave.py`
6. `workflows/research_market_overview.md`
7. Test full loop: workflow → tool → db.js → Supabase
8. `tools/intake.js`, `generate_proposal.js`, `activate.js`
9. All remaining research workflows + tools
10. Report assembly + PDF generation
11. Resend email delivery
12. Orchestrator + scheduled trigger

---

## Future: Website & Admin Panel

Client-facing site (intake form, about page) + admin panel (view clients/reports, "Run Now" button per proposition). Admin run button wraps the `--force` CLI logic. Build after core system is working. Keep business logic modular so a web layer can sit on top without rework.

---

## Architecture

```
workflows/   ← plain-language SOPs
tools/       ← Python scripts (execution)
db.js        ← all Supabase queries (Node.js)
.env         ← all credentials
outputs/     ← date-stamped PDFs (6 months)
.tmp/        ← disposable intermediates
assets/      ← logo + brand assets
```

Agents read workflows → call tools → write to Supabase via `db.js`.
PDFs uploaded to Supabase Storage `reports` bucket, URL saved to `reports.pdf_url`.
Orchestrator calls `getDuePropositions()` for scheduled runs (active propositions only).
